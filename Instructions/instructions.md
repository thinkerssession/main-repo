# Readme

This Repository should contain files that describe the different common problems faced across all Afican countries.

Each file should contain a statement of the problem, status of the problem, its causes, solutions that have been put forth, success rate
of the available solutions, a proposed solution to the problem. Also, a solution to make available solutions work.

All those interested are welcome to contribute, your views and thoughts are most valued. You can add your thoughts to 
the files push and update to ensure the repository is always up-to-date and no information is lost.

Kindly ensure when you clone this repository, you familiarize yourself with all files to ensure there is no
repeated information and the code will be organized.
This code will be open source, if any one is so inclined to work on implementation of any of the proposed solution
you are free to do so.

During implementation, you are also required to present to the members of thinkers session on how you plan to do it, 
those interested and available of course. I'm sure
they would be happy to help.

This is just the beginning, we have not gotten all necessary information to start on implementation, there is no plan on it yet either.

If you can't do the implementation on your own don't worry, that's why we are here, 
neither can we but together we shall think of ways.
