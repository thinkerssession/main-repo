# INTRODUCTION

This Repository is created for the purpose of gathering ideas on developing an education platform to solve some basic problems in education.

Introducing EduFix, the revolutionary platform designed to solve educational challenges across Africa. EduFix is an online platform that provides innovative solutions to problems faced by students, teachers, and educational institutions across the continent. One of the key issues EduFix addresses is absenteeism on the part of teachers. Many schools in Africa struggle with a shortage of qualified teachers, and even when teachers are available, they may not always show up for work. 

This can have a significant impact on students' learning outcomes and overall academic performance. EduFix provides a range of tools and resources to address absenteeism among teachers. For example, the platform includes a teacher attendance tracking system that allows school administrators to monitor teacher attendance in real-time. This helps to identify patterns of absenteeism and take appropriate action to address the issue. In addition to tracking attendance, EduFix also offers professional development resources for teachers. 

These resources include online training courses, lesson planning tools, and access to a network of educators across Africa. By providing teachers with the support they need to improve their skills and knowledge, EduFix aims to reduce absenteeism and improve the overall quality of education in Africa. Overall, EduFix is a game-changing platform that has the potential to transform education across Africa. With its focus on solving real-world problems faced by students and teachers, EduFix is poised to become a leader in the educational technology space in Africa and beyond.
